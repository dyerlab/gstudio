\usage{
bad_parents(df, AdultID = "ID", OffID = "OffID", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} with identification and locus columns.}

\item{AdultID}{The column header for id of the adults. All adults have unique
identification numbers and all offspring have the the same number as
the maternal/paternal individual from which they were sampled or are being
compared.  Default = "ID"}

\item{OffID}{A column indicating offspring identification numbers.  By default
all adults have OffID=0 (this is how I tell if they are really adults and not
offspring), and all offspring have OffID != 0. Default = "OffID"}

\item{verbose}{Print out mismatched parent/offspring pairs.}
}
\value{
The \code{data.frame} with a new column, Is.Parent with 
 values of TRUE/FALSE/NA (the NA is for adults).
}
\description{
This function takes a \code{data.frame} full of parents and offspring
 and checks to see if the offspring are actually assigned to a compatible
 adult.
