\title{Estimate optimal sampling allocation}
\usage{
optimal_sampling(N, phi)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The total sample size (number of strata * number of individuals 
pre stratum)}

\item{phi}{An estimate of the level of differentiation.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with a plot of the variance in phi due to
 different sample sizes with a region of +/- 10% of the provided
 phi value
}
\description{
This function returns a graphical representation of optimal sampling
 allocations given an estimate of the total number of samples you 
 are looking at genotyping and the amount of expected differentiation
 among strata.
}
\examples{
N <- 400
Phi <- 0.25
optimal_sampling( N, Phi )
