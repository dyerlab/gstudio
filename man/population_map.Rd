\title{Retrieve a map for a set of populations.}
\usage{
population_map(coords, map.source = "google", map.type = "terrain", zoom = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{A \code{data.frame} that has Strata, Latitude, and Longitude}

\item{map.source}{Where the map should be retrieved from. Common options include
 \describe{
   \item{google}{Get the map from Google Maps (this is the default)}
   \item{osm}{Open Streat Map derived}
}}

\item{map.type}{What kind of map to use.  Current types include:
\describe{
 \item{sattelite}{A satellite image of the area.}
 \item{terrain}{A stylized topological map (this is the default).}
 \item{road}{The default google road map.}
 \item{hybrid}{Mix of road and terrain maps.}
}}

\item{zoom}{The default zoom level when using google maps (default NA).  If omitted
the code will attempt to define the map by the bounding box defined by the coords}
}
\value{
A map raster
}
\description{
This function uses the \code{ggmap} package to grab a map of the area where the
 samples in the , are located.
}
\note{
This is a bit of a rough attempt and should be used only sparingly.  I have found 
 that the ability to get Google Maps that cover all the sites is a bit difficult 
 unless you play around with the zoom option.  Google has fixed zoom levels so you may
 need to try this a few times before getting what you want.
