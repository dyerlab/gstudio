\title{Produces offspring}
\usage{
mate(mom, dad = NULL, N = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mom}{This is the 'maternal' individual in that all the
metadata in the \code{data.frame} that describes this individual 
will be transfered to the offspring.}

\item{dad}{This is the 'paternal' individual and will contribute only
half of its genetic compliment to the offspring.}

\item{N}{The number of offspring to produce.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of offspring.
}
\description{
This function is mostly for simulation work and functions to 
 produce a set of offspring for the individuals passed.
}
\note{
There are several 'hidden' things in this routine.  First, if you do not
 pass a 'dad' object, it will assume you want a selfed offspring.  Second, it 
 will by default only make a single offspring.  Next, if you have a column 
 labeled "Sex" it will make a random selection of which sex each offspring 
 should be and only mate the opposite sexes based upon the levels of the values in
 the Sex column.  Finally, if there are columns ID and OffID in the mom, then all 
 offspring will have the same ID as the mom but will have OffID equal to 1:N to 
 conform with how the functions like \code{paternity()} operate.  If you do not 
 have ID and OffID then it will do nothing special.  This can be more than
 one individual mom & dad, but if you pass several, they will all have the same
 number of offspring (if you only specify a single value of N) or different 
 numbers of offspring (if N is passed as a vector and is of length equal to 
 that of mom and dad)

f <- data.frame(Allele=LETTERS[1:2], Frequency=c(0.5,0.5))
adults <- data.frame( ID=1:2, Locus=make_loci(f,N=2) )

mate( adults[1,], adults[2,], N=10)
