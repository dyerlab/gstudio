\title{Performs 'Autocorrelation Analysis}
\usage{
genetic_autocorrelation(P, G, bins, perms = 0, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A square physical distance matrix}

\item{G}{A square genetic distance matrix (same size as P)}

\item{bins}{The distance bins to be estimated.  These will be taken sequentially 
such that the first bin will be all observations whose separation is greater than
binsize[1] and less than binsize[2].}

\item{perms}{The number of permutations to use to test significance
at each distance bin.}

\item{plot}{A flag (default=FALSE) to show distribution of randomized 
correlations.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with bins and correlations.
}
\description{
This function takes two distance matrices, one for physical separation
 and the other for genetic separation as well as a bin size and performs
 the spatial autocorrelation analysis of Smouse & Peakall (1999).
