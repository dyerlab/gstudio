\title{This function finds a set of potential parents from an offspring.}
\usage{
parent_finder(df, ID = "ID", OffID = "OffID")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.frame} of individuals adults individuals.  This will
be the population from which the identification of potential parentage will
be examined..}

\item{ID}{The adult "ID" column designator (default="ID").  All adults 
have a unique ID designation.  This will be how each adult is identified.}

\item{OffID}{This is a non-zero number for each offspring.  The combination of 
ID and OffID should be able to be used to identify each offspring uniquely.  All
adults have OffID=0, by definition.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following columns.  ID = the offspring id, 
 OffID = the offspring OffID (these two will identify the offspring uniquely), 
 ParentID = the putative parent identified, T = the multilocus transition 
 probability associated with the offspring and parent.
}
\description{
This is a general exclusion finder for a single parent. For dual
 parent exclusion, you can use the \code{paternity()} function.
