\title{Routines used in spatial analysis of genetic marker data}
\description{
gstudio is a suite of tools used in the spatial analysis
 of population genetic data created for the book 
 "Applied Landscape Genetics" by R.J. Dyer.   This version
 of the package (1.X) is a significant deviant from the 
 previous (versions 0.X) resulting from an entire re-write
 of the package to maximize ease of use and algorithm quickness.
 As such, previous scripts using gstudio (vers. 0.X) will need
 to be refactored a bit.  While this can be a bit of a pain, the
 larger utility of the new format will pay off in spades.

There are some very good examples of the components of this package are used
in the vignettes for this package.
