gstudio 1.6.0 - 20230515
-----------------
* [REQ] Test for HWP and LD similar to that implemented in Genepop? I work with microsatellite loci that have many rare alleles, so a HWP/LD test with a MC algorithm similar to that used in Genepop would be ideal
* [ADD] Added heirfstat to genetic_structure to allow functional calling 
* [ADD] Added hooks into genetic distances from pegas through genetic_distance() for other distance measures.
* [FIX] stratum He/Ho genetic_diversity Hs
* [FIX] Add permutation to Fst() for significance
* [FIX] pies_on_map apparently is broken
* [FIX] Problem with having a misssing genotype for type="column" in first row.  Odd problem.
* [ADD] Feedback for reading in columns for read_population() when > 500 loci to provide some level of feedback to the user showing it is doing something and not just sitting there.
* [ADD] Added Hi (individual heterozygosity) function.
* [FIX] Change 'locus' to 'loci' in frequency_matrix() to be consistent with the frequencies() function argument list.
* [FIX] Catching problem where empty (instead of NA) data was causing locus(.,type="separated") to fail.



gstudio 1.5.3 - 20210207
-----------------
* [FIX] Reworked -.locus to return offpsring unreduced when ploidy mistake instead of stoping on error to help the user better understand where the problems are. 
* [FIX] Fixed warning that was coming in from column_class() function.


gstudio 1.5
-----------------

* [ADD] Added option to specify inbreeding (F) in make_population() function
* [FIX] Fixed problem with wrapper function around Nei line 9 Stratum => stratum
* [ADD] Added Fst as random anova version.
* [FIX] Added ability to pass data.frame with one or more loci to it to genotype_frequency() function
* [FIX] Refined make_population() specifying F!=0 with less suckiness.
* [ADD] Added function make_loci() to make vectors of loci outside of making populations.  Fixed problem with specifying F for small N as well.
* [ADD] Added frequency_matrix() function to reshape data.frame of allele frequencies across strata for a particular locus.

gstudio 1.4
-----------------

* [ADD] Takes centroid of coordinates in strata_coordinates (default) if more than one coordinate is provided.





gstudio 1.3
-----------------
* [ADD] Added ability to use RAD-seq style data to frequencies() function.  Here each locus is represented by the posterior likelihood of each genotype (e.g., three columns per locus).  Your locus columns will be numeric and labeled as 'LocusName_1', 'LocusName_2', and 'LocusName_3'.  It will split on the underscore and assume that the middle one (the _2) is the heterozygote.  Alleles will be A (estimated from _1 as homozygote + het) and B (estimated from _3 + het).
* [ADD] Filter to import CDPOP genotype files via read_population().

* [ADD] Added kronecker_delta() function to return locus differences after Ritland 2000
* [FIX] Problem with pies_on_map() where one population was always a bit off.  This is really not a problem with the plotting, it is more of a problem with the ratio of h/w for the plot.  Make them the same and it will be fine.
* [ADD] Added option to sort strata in strata_coords (default=FALSE) in alphabetical order.
* [FIX] Inconsistance in case for arguments to strata_coordinates;  was longitude/latitude rather than Longitude/Latitude, also had to change stuff in pies_on_map and plot.data.frame

* [FIX] Fixed the situation where you create a locus without a 'type' defined and it would not sort the alleles in ascending numeric order, rather it would sort them in ascii order, even if you had set the optional argment as 'phased=FALSE'.
* [ADD] Added ability to subtract vectors of loci instead of single locus estimates usiung the loc1 - loc2 operator.
* [ADD] Added bad_parents() to scan offspring, mother data.frames and determine if the mother could be the real mother.

* [FIX] Changed mate() function for simplicity.
* [FIX] Made "Stratum" column from make_population() a factor and made the stratum of the resulting population not "Stratum" but "Population"
* [FIX] Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest() for when a data.frame is passed with only one locus, there is no need to do the multilocus response.

gstudio 1.0 
-----------------

* This is a complete rewrite of the gstudio (ver. 0.X) package.  What I have done is to remake
  the fundamental locus object as an S3 object rather than an S4 class. 
* Too much has changed to interate through all of the changes.  To get a good idea of how to 
  use the new functionality see http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/
* Integrated, where possible, spatial connections to both the raster and sp packages such that 
  direct analyses of spatial population genetic processes can be accessed.
* This first version has the following functional components.
    - locus(), alleles(), frequencies()
    - heterozygosity in terms of He(), Fis(), Ho()
    - genetic_diversity() for parameters Ae(), A(), A95() with rarefaction()
    - genetic_distance() for dist_amova(), dist_bray(), dist_euclidean(), dist_cgd(), dist_nei(), dist_jaccard(), dist_Dps()
    - genetic_structure() for Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest()
    - spatial plotting and mapping using sp, raster, and google_maps API's
    - paternity() with transition_probability() for both strict and fractional paternity.
    - parent offspring stuff with with minus_mom()
    - added make_population() and mate() for making random populations
