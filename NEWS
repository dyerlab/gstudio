gstudio 1.3
-----------------
* [ADD] Added ability to use RAD-seq style data to frequencies() function.  Here each locus is represented by the posterior likelihood of each genotype (e.g., three columns per locus).  Your locus columns will be numeric and labeled as 'LocusName_1', 'LocusName_2', and 'LocusName_3'.  It will split on the underscore and assume that the middle one (the _2) is the heterozygote.  Alleles will be A (estimated from _1 as homozygote + het) and B (estiamted from _3 + het).
* [ADD] Filter to import CDPOP genotype files via read_population().
* [ADD] Added 'haploid' type for read_population().
* [ADD] Added ability to pass migration matrix to mate() function as well as constant migration.
* [ADD] Ability to call mate() with vectors of individuals at once and to specify either uniform or variable numbers of offspring per pair.
* [FIX] Problem with dist_bray() and dist_jaccard() with missing data.
* [ADD] Added function to_mv_freq() to provide multilocus frequency estiamtes across strata in matrix format.
* [CUTOFF]  This is where new features for Dyer (2014) stopped.

* [FIX] Problem with pies_on_map() where one population was always a bit off.  This is really not a problem with the plotting, it is more of a problem with the ratio of h/w for the plot.  Make them the same and it will be fine.
* [ADD] Added option to sort strata in strata_coords (default=FALSE) in alphabetical order.
* [FIX] Inconsistance in case for arguments to strata_coordinates;  was longitude/latitude rather than Longitude/Latitude, also had to change stuff in pies_on_map and plot.data.frame

gstudio 1.1 
-----------------
* [ADD] Added write_population() function to save textual output as text, GENEPOP, and STRUCTURE.
* [ADD] Added several functions to aid in export translations for other programs such as GENEPOP and STRUCTURE.  These functions include: to_fixed_locus(), to_STRUCTURE(), and to_GENEPOP().

* [FIX] Fixed the situation where you create a locus without a 'type' defined and it would not sort the alleles in ascending numeric order, rather it would sort them in ascii order, even if you had set the optional argment as 'phased=FALSE'.
* [ADD] Added ability to subtract vectors of loci instead of single locus estimates usiung the loc1 - loc2 operator.
* [ADD] Added bad_parents() to scan offspring, mother data.frames and determine if the mother could be the real mother.
* [ADD] Added parent_finder() to do fractional single parent identification.
* [ADD] Added ability to subtract vectors of loci instead of single locus estimates.
* [ADD] Added bad_parents() to scan offspring, mother data.frames and determine if the mother could be the real mother.
* [ADD] Added parent_finder() to do fractional maternal individual identification.
* [CHANGE] Dropped warming when subtracting loci when one is missing.  Used to result in a stop() but now only provides a warning and returns the left hand locus (the one the subtraction is being done from).
* [FIX] Changed mate() function for simplicity.
* [FIX] Made "Stratum" column from make_population() a factor and made the stratum of the resulting population not "Stratum" but "Population"
* [FIX] Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest() for when a data.frame is passed with only one locus, there is no need to do the multilocus response.  
* [FIX] Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest() for when subset of data is passed (e.g., stratum with zeros counts), the zeros are ignored.
* [FIX] transition_probability() had an issue with double hets.
* [FIX] Fixed problem when importing data from text file where you have only one external variable.  
* [ADD] Added paternity and other items to documentation.
* [ADD] Added ability to input GenePop files using read_population(file, type="genepop")
* [ADD] Added pairwise option to genetic_structure() function.
* [FIX] The function genetic_diversity() did not recognize the 'stratum' option 
* [ADD] Added Fis to genetic_diversity() for continuity.
* [FIX] A() was not accepting data.frames as it should have been.
* [FIX] Multilocus estimate of Gst_prime() was wrong if there was a single locus estimate that was negative, in which case the harmonic mean is not correct.
* [ADD] Added function strata_distance() to return distance matrix between stratum based upon either Euclidean distance or great-circle distance.
* [ADD] Added function genotype_frequencies() to return both observed and expected frequencies for a given locus.
* [ADD] Added ", space="free", scales="free_x" to plot_frequencies() for non-overlapping allele counts and better plots.
* [FIX] Fixed exclusion_probability() to return numeric values for various columns and added multilocus exclusion to result.
* [FIX] Dataframe column name on multilocus Ho was incorrect
* [ADD] Changed the transition_probability() function to handle multilocus estimates of both two parent and single parent situations when data are contained in data.frame elements.
* [FIX] Removed missing data from estimation of genotype_frequencies()
* [ADD] Added ability for mate() to do replacement random mating (e.g., take all individuals in data.frame and make equal size next generation using complete random mating).
* [ADD] Added ability to get SpatialPoints object from strata_coordinates() function as well as data.frame.
* [ADD] Added function optimal_sampling() to help estimate optimal sampling designs for methods requiring estimates of genetic differentiation.

gstudio 1.0 
-----------------

* This is a complete rewrite of the gstudio (ver. 0.X) package.  What I have done is to remake
  the fundamental locus object as an S3 object rather than an S4 class. 
* Too much has changed to interate through all of the changes.  To get a good idea of how to 
  use the new functionality see http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/
* Integrated, where possible, spatial connections to both the raster and sp packages such that 
  direct analyses of spatial population genetic processes can be accessed.
* This first version has the following functional components.
    - locus(), alleles(), frequencies()
    - heterozygosity in terms of He(), Fis(), Ho()
    - genetic_diversity() for parameters Ae(), A(), A95() with rarefaction()
    - genetic_distance() for dist_amova(), dist_bray(), dist_euclidean(), dist_cgd(), dist_nei(), dist_jaccard(), dist_Dps()
    - genetic_structure() for Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest()
    - spatial plotting and mapping using sp, raster, and google_maps API's
    - paternity() with transition_probability() for both strict and fractional paternity.
    - parent offspring stuff with with minus_mom()
    - added make_population() and mate() for making random populations
